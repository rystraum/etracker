Setup:
  Admin creates a location.
  For each piece of equipment in the location, admin creates a corresponding unit in the system.
  An initial audit log is created that requires at least 1 photo of the unit before saving the unit for the first time.

Transfers:
  > states: pending, received
  Source location creates a transfer log stating unit, destination location, transfer date
  Destination location marks the transfer log as received when s/he receives the item

Audits:
  > can change unit state: good, damaged, missing
  Auditor creates an audit log: barcode, unit state, comments, images

Maintenance / Repairs:
  > can change unit state to: good, under routine maintenance, under repair
  Maintenance person creates a maintenance log: 
    supplier (defaults to unit's supplier), name of person who did maintenance, start date/time, end date/time

  If unit's last maintenance log is more than unit.maintenance_schedule days ago, unit appears in location manager's dashboard as scheduled for maintenance.

  (IB) Start Maintenance: change unit state to under maintenance
  (IB) End Maintenance: change unit state to good / overridden state

(IB) Condemn:
  > will change unit state to condemned
